### Tmux Config: Saving Sessions Across Reboots

I have a tmux configuration that I use across multiple systems. I'd like to enhance it to save the current session across reboots. Can you provide a step-by-step guide or a configuration snippet that achieves this?

### Requirements

* The solution should work with my existing tmux configuration.
* It should automatically save the current session when I close tmux or reboot my system.
* It should be able to restore the session to its previous state.

### Desired Output

* A modified tmux configuration or a script that saves and restores sessions across reboots.

### Additional Context

* I'm using [insert tmux version, if known] on [insert operating system, e.g., Linux, macOS].
* My current tmux configuration includes [list any relevant settings or plugins].

This prompt incorporates the following techniques:

* **Clear instructions**: The prompt clearly states the goal and requirements.
* **Specific details**: The prompt provides relevant context, such as the use of tmux and the desire to save sessions across reboots.
* **Desired output**: The prompt specifies the expected outcome, making it easier for the model to provide a relevant response.
