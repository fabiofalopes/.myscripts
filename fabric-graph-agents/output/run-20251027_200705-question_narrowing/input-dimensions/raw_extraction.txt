# Creative Process Fragmentation and Recomposition

I feel like my creative process is constantly fragmenting and recomposing itself in ways I can't predict or control. It's like watching a kaleidoscope that keeps turning itself.

# Idea Avalanche Anxiety

Sometimes I get overwhelmed by how many ideas I have and how few of them ever see the light of day. It's like having a library in my head where most of the books are blank or half-written.

# Fear of Idea Loss

I worry that I'm losing ideas faster than I can capture them, like trying to hold water in my hands.

# Obsession With Idea Capture Systems

I've become obsessed with finding the perfect system to capture and organize everything, but the perfect system keeps changing before I can even finish building it.

# Digital Garden vs Second Brain Tension

Part of me wants to build a beautiful digital garden, but another part just wants to dump everything into a second brain and let the connections emerge naturally. I can't decide which approach is more 'me'.

# Tool Fatigue and Perfectionism Paralysis

The tools keep changing—Notion to Obsidian to Roam to whatever's next—and I feel like I'm always migrating, never settling, never actually doing the work. Maybe the real problem isn't the tools but my inability to commit to imperfection.
