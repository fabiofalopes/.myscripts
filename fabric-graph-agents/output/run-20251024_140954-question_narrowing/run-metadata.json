so we are on the current mission of setting up our ubiquiti air router HP it's an older device the one that we that we know of it's it's gotta be in the current context now we even already are to the point that we have everything in our side now we just fresh installed custom firmware we are interfacing directly with this UART even though that we didn't have the appropriate cable we figured it out by doing a voltage divider for the data channel banger love that solution it worked and well currently we have open router installed and to be quite frank now it is the time where I'm like okay cool so oh my god this is quite a lot right yeah it is I'm saying that I'm overwhelmed not to say that there is a lot to be overwhelmed about though big picture here of what can we do with this I curious though in the main aspects I mainly curious here actually is understanding open router together with specific hardware so I'm like trying to really illuminate myself trying to close these gaps here in what I'm trying to describe which is this well how the distribution runs on all these types of hardware all these different types of controllers I'm gonna now just throw assumptions I can assume that maybe like all types of builds are done for all types of chips controllers things that come into weird routers and that's I guess how you get this ecosystem of very abundant just you can get it to run almost everywhere these days but then again this hardware part so the idea of question is more like each device has their own capabilities right so what I'm trying to understand really is what capabilities our device has meaning some devices have capabilities to inject packets to do like more more broad spectrum, indeed at the end of the day I'm thinking yeah that's relevant to say when it's just like a normal just like a normal antenna like that you would use typically to be a client and that you use those terminologies when you're like using those types of devices also to like kind of be like sort of um not to explain not explaining myself correctly but like uh those devices instead they are not supposed to like i guess be really access points even though they can and they can like really do those types of operations like more in the office things of Linux nature that's what I'm more about it's kind of like main thing I'm trying to talk about here now in our case we have this device which we have been exploring at full speed and even though that like I don't I know that I'm not really narrowing great the questions just trying to understand exactly what the fuck can this hardware really do in its huge scope and for some reason yeah if I say Kali Linux and it's for some reason kind of like just yeah I'm just trying to really broad the specter here because for example a router like this can be used for a shit ton of uses and we can do lots of things with it and if I understand it even as itself two radios so like and it is like this mini switch on on it where we have a",
