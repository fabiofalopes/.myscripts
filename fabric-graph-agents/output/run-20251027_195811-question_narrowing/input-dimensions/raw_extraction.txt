# Router Admin Password Change

The very first thing I do is change the router’s admin password. The sticker on the bottom of the unit usually has a laughably weak default like admin/admin; leaving that in place is practically an invitation.

# Firmware Updates Schedule

I schedule firmware updates the same way I schedule dental cleanings: automatically if the vendor supports it, or a recurring calendar reminder every first Monday so I never forget.

# Wi-Fi Encryption Protocol

I switch the Wi-Fi encryption to the newest protocol the router offers—ideally WPA3, but at minimum WPA2-AES. Anything labeled WEP or TKIP might as well be unencrypted.

# Guest Network Isolation

I spin up a separate guest SSID for visitors and for every questionable IoT gadget. That way if a cheap smart plug turns malicious it can’t sniff traffic from my laptops or NAS.

# Router Management Interface Exposure

I disable WAN-side management. If I need to reach my router remotely I’d rather set up a VPN tunnel than leave the web console exposed to the entire Internet.

# Complex Wi-Fi Passphrase

I pick a Wi-Fi passphrase that is long enough to feel mildly inconvenient to type—four or five random diceware words beats a short string of symbols any day.

# DNS Security Filtering

I point DNS to a filtered resolver like Quad9 or Cloudflare’s malware-blocking service; it’s a zero-cost layer that keeps known-bad domains from resolving.

# Backup Router Configuration

Once everything is locked down I export the router config to a small encrypted file on my NAS. If the hardware dies I can restore settings without starting from scratch.
