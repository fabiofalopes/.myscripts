# JumpServer Branding Guide

To customize the logo and login image, replace the files in this folder with your own images.
**Keep the filenames exactly the same!**

## Files to Replace:

1.  **logo.png** - Main Logo (Top left)
2.  **logo_text.png** - Logo with Text
3.  **login_image.png** - The large image on the login screen
4.  **facio.ico** - The browser tab icon (Favicon)

## How to Apply:
1.  Put your new images in this folder (`custom_branding`).
2.  Run the `apply_branding.sh` script.
3.  Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5).
