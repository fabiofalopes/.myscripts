# Help Documentation Summary

I've created two complementary help documents for the `yt` command:

## 1. Short Help (`HELP_SHORT.txt`)

**Purpose:** Terminal-friendly, quick reference  
**Location:** `./HELP_SHORT.txt`  
**Usage:** `yt --help` or `cat HELP_SHORT.txt`

**Features:**
- 80 characters wide (terminal-safe)
- ~70 lines (fits in one screen)
- Core commands highlighted
- Real examples with YouTube URLs
- Quick tips and configuration info
- Links to full documentation

**Best for:** Users who want a quick reminder of common commands

## 2. Extended Help (`HELP.md`)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive command reference  
**Location:** `./HELP.md`  
**Usage:** `yt help` or `cat HELP.md` or read in GitHub

**Contents (900+ lines):**
- Quick navigation shortcuts
- Basic commands with examples
- All URL formats
- Detailed mode explanations:
  - Smart Mode (default)
  - Quick Mode (~25s)
  - Deep Mode (~70s)
  - Preview Mode (0 API calls)
  - Expert Mode (exact patterns)
- Model selection guide
- Advanced options (verbose, debug, no-analysis)
- V3.0 Cache system documentation
- V4.0 Pattern discovery commands
- V4.0 Iterative workflow commands
- V4.0 Vault operations commands
- Configuration reference
- Real output examples
- Common issues and solutions
- Performance tips
- Obsidian integration guide
- Examples walkthrough
- Troubleshooting checklist

**Best for:** Learning the full capabilities, troubleshooting, reference

## Key Documentation Features

### Both documents include:
✅ Real YouTube URLs in examples  
✅ Terminal-compatible (no complex Unicode)  
✅ Grouped by use case  
✅ Progressive disclosure (simple → advanced)  
✅ Links between sections  
✅ V3.0 and V4.0 commands  

### Formatting
✅ Short help: Plain text, 80-column width  
✅ Extended help: Markdown with sections, tables, code blocks  
✅ Consistent style with README.md  

### Coverage
✅ Basic usage (quick start)  
✅ All 8 core modes explained  
✅ Cache system (V3.0)  
✅ Pattern discovery (V4.0 preview)  
✅ Iterative workflow (V4.0 preview)  
✅ Vault operations (V4.0 preview)  
✅ Configuration options  
✅ Troubleshooting guide  

## Integration with CLI

To use these in the `yt` command:

```bash
# Update argparse in yt script to use these files:

# Short help (--help flag)
# Already using from argparse formatter

# Full help (new yt help command)
if args.help_extended:
    with open('HELP.md', 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())
    sys.exit(0)

# Quick help text in error messages
# Show excerpt from HELP_SHORT.txt
```

## Next Steps

To integrate into the CLI, the `yt` script should:

1. ✅ Keep short help in argparse (auto-generated or use HELP_SHORT.txt)
2. Add `yt help` command to show full HELP.md
3. Update error messages to suggest `yt help` for more information
4. Link help files in usage output

## Design Decisions

**Why two documents?**
- **Short help:** Instant reference, works in tight terminal spaces
- **Extended help:** Complete reference, discoverable in docs
- **Complementary:** Both point to each other

**Format choices:**
- Short help: Plain text (always works, no rendering needed)
- Extended help: Markdown (better organization, readable anywhere)

**Coverage balance:**
- Short help: Most common commands only
- Extended help: Everything including V4.0 preview features
- Neither duplicates the README.md (different purposes)

## Files Created/Updated

- **HELP_SHORT.txt** - New, terminal-friendly quick reference
- **HELP.md** - New, comprehensive markdown reference
- **README.md** - Unchanged (user guide for installation/concepts)
- **START_HERE.md** - Unchanged (AI agent onboarding)
- **CONTEXT.md** - Unchanged (project history)

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Version:** V4.0 (Status & Vault Commands)  
**Integrated into `yt` CLI** ✅
